<h2>My education</h2> <p class="justify">
I always had an engineer mindset. I just did not know it until a long time, it
started when I was 15 and I realised that I did enjoy mathematics. On the advice
of my friend and mathematic teacher, I decided to follow the path of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles"><em>classe
préparatoire</em></a>, at Lycée Kléber in Strasbourg.
A french two years period after high school, where you receive
around 20 hours of mathematics and 15 hours of physics per week. <br/>
After successfully
finishing these two years, I went to one of the best french engineering school, the
<a href="http://www.mines-stetienne.fr/"><em>Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne</em></a> to
learn physics, as I was very interested in astrophysics. And then, I went to the
conclusion that physics as it is, is not as rigorous as mathematics which was a
little cold shower. <br/>
There I saw that the most powerful machines of our time
operates on the most basic mathematical operations that exist: the CPU. That's
how I started as a computer scientist, because of both my love of mathematics, and
my passion to comprehend how a system works deep inside.
