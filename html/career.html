<h2>My Career</h2> <p class="justify">
With the engineer mindset I made my own during my education, I built my professional
career with this idea of understanding how computers work, what happens from
the creation of a packet in the kernel, to it reaching another computer, and finally
how is it analysed and for example rendered, in the case of a browser.
My first step was at Gemalto where I was a system administrator on Linux CentOs,
and I discover the joy of scripting and modifying an environment to both satisfy
what users expect of the system and to enhance it.
My second step was working in the web development with CGI for Louis Vuitton,
which was a logical step since I learnt a lot at school that year about the J2E
framework, which is the backend of a Java Web Application in general. I learnt
many techniques regarding the new HTML5 technologies,
under the supervision of Thibaut de Broca, my team lead, who always pushed us to
go harder.
Finally, I wanted to see a little more about the world we live in, as well as discover
what it was like to administer windows environment, and Lexmark hungary gave me that
possibility, and after a successful collaboration with them, I am more than eager
to go back to programming today.
