<h2>My Career</h2> <p class="justify">
  With the engineer mindset I made my own during my education, I built my professional
  career with this idea of understanding how computers work, what happens from
  the creation of a packet in the kernel, to it reaching another computer, and finally
  how is it analysed and for example rendered, in the case of a browser.<br/>
  My first step was at <a href="http://www.gemalto.com/">Gemalto</a> where
  I was a system administrator on <a href="https://www.centos.org/"> Linux CentOs</a>,
  and I discover the joy of scripting and modifying an environment to both satisfy
  what users expect of the system and to enhance it.<br/>
  My second step was working in the web development with <a href="http://www.cgi.com/en">CGI</a>
  for Louis Vuitton,
  which was a logical step since I learnt a lot at school that year about the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition">J2E</a>
  framework, which is most of the time the backend of a Java Web Application. I learnt
  many techniques regarding the new HTML5 technologies,
  under the supervision of Thibaut de Broca, my team lead, who always pushed us to
  go harder.<br/>
  Finally, I wanted to see a little more about the world we live in, as well as discover
  what it was like to administer Windows environment, and <a href="http://www.lexmark.com/hu_hu.html">
  Lexmark Hungary</a> gave me that
  possibility. <br/>
  After a successful collaboration with them, I am more than eager
  to go back to programming today.
