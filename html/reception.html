<h2><u>My philosophy</u></h2>
<p class="justify">
I am a computer scientist, interested in every area of the computer sciences,
from the computer graphics to the network security. I am as well really interested
in a wide variety of topics including philosophy, social networking, and analytics.
I love to learn new skills and I believe in the Do It Yourself philosophy acquiring knowledge.
