<h2>My philosophy</h2>
<p class="justify">
I am a computer scientist, interested in every area of computer sciences,
from the computer graphics to the network security. I am as well really interested
in a wide variety of topics including philosophy, social networking, and analytics.
I love to learn new skills and I believe in the <em>Do It Yourself philosophy</em> to acquire knowledge.

<h2>About this site</h2>
<p class="justify">
  I decided to do this website because I am a programmer and I figured that
  I might as well show a little what I can do through a little front end, and with
  the help of tools such as <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less CSS</a> and
  <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.
